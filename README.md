A collection of HTML/JavaScript experiments and tools built through AI-assisted "vibe coding".

## Live Site

## About
This repository contains various HTML applications and experiments created using LLM prompts. Each file represents a different experiment or tool, ranging from animations to interactive applications.

## Structure
- HTML files: Individual experiments and applications
- `gather_links.py`: Script to collect commit history and URLs
- `build_colophon.py`: Script to generate a colophon page with commit details
- `build_index.py`: Script to automatically generate the index page

## Deployment
The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment process:
1. Generates an index page listing all experiments
2. Optionally builds a colophon page with commit history
3. Publishes everything to GitHub Pages

## Adding New Experiments
Simply create a new HTML file and push it to the repository. The index will automatically update to include your new experiment.
